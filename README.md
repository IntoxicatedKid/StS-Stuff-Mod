# StS-Stuff-Mod  
Adds 20 Cards, 17 Exhibits from Slay the Spire to the game. Many contents from StS are already imported and redesigned in LBoL, so i focus on things that aren't in this game yet.  
You need BepInEx and LBoL-Entity-Sideloader to use this mod.

Installation(Github): Download StSStuffMod.dll and place it to Steam\steamapps\common\LBoL\BepInEx\plugins

Known issue: Runic Dome is poorly coded.  
you can't see the added exhibits in the collection yet.
