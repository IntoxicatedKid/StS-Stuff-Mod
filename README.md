# StS-Stuff-Mod  
Adds 10 Cards, 6 Exhibits from Slay the Spire to the game. Many contents from StS are already implemented and redesigned in LBoL, so i focus on things that aren't in this game yet.  
You need BepInEx and LBoL-Entity-Sideloader to use this mod.

Installation: Download StSStuffMod.dll and place it to Steam\steamapps\common\LBoL\BepInEx\plugins
