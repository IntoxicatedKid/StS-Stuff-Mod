# StS-Stuff-Mod  
Adds 10 Cards, 6 Exhibits from Slay the Spire to the game. Many contents from StS are already imported and redesigned in LBoL, so i focus on things that aren't in this game yet.  
You need BepInEx and LBoL-Entity-Sideloader to use this mod.

Installation(Github): Download StSStuffMod.dll and place it to Steam\steamapps\common\LBoL\BepInEx\plugins

Known issue: Runic Dome is poorly coded, i don't know how to code Fusion Hammer, Coffee Dripper, Ectoplasm  
Added Exhibits are currently unable to see in collection.
